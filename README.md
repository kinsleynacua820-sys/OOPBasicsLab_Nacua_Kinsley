Activity 1:
In this activity, I created a Student class.
The class has information about a student, like name, age, and grade.
I also created a constructor to set the values and a method to display the student information.
In the main program, I created two student objects and showed their details.

Activity 2:
In this activity, I made the student attributes private.
This means they cannot be accessed directly outside the class.
I used the getter and setter methods to get and update the values safely.
This activity helped me understand how encapsulation works in Java.

Activity 3:
In this activity, I created a Vehicle class.
It has brand, model, and speed as attributes.
In the main program, I created one vehicle and accelerated it, then displayed its status.

Avtivity 4:
In this activity, I created a BankAccount class.
It has account holder name and balance.
I added methods to deposit and withdraw money.
Using the Scanner the user can enter amounts and the program shows the updated balance.

Activity 5:
In this activity, I created a Circle class.
It has a radius as its attribute.
I added methods to compute the area and circumference of the circle.
I created two circle objects with different radii and displayed their results.
